Challenge Chapter 7:
=============================

Yes.
Compare Booleans and Numbers. 0 = false, and non zero = true.
This is the case in C and C++. We might want to add this for
increased familiarity.

Compare strings with each other based on lexicographic ordering.
This is the case in pretty much every language I've used.

Reasons not to: Javascript PTSD. Automatic type conversion
can lead to bugs.

7.3

Right now, when dividing a number by zero, it uses the Kotlin default behavior for doubles,
which gives infinity. In Java and Kotlin, it throws an exception for ints, but gives infinity for doubles.
In Typescript and Dart, it always gives infinity. In Go, it throws an exception always.

(Also for 0/0, Kotlin gives NaN. So another special case that we don't want to handle)

I think for Lox, we should probably fail, since handling infinity as a special case might be too complicated
for now.
